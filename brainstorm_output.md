## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed a comprehensive list of 47 features bridging recreational fun and professional utility.
- Resolved the "One-Stop Shop" problem through a unified data and video strategy.
- Established a roadmap that prioritizes core utility while leaving room for AI breakthroughs.

**Creative Facilitation Narrative:**
This session transformed a "One-Stop Shop" vision into a "Strategic Intelligence Platform." We started with the concept of fragmented sites and used Analogical Thinking to borrow the power of Bloomberg Terminals and the accountability of Chess.com. We then humanized the tech through the Persona Journey of "Salty Sam" and "Casual Cathy," ensuring the app scales from high-density professional use to effortless mobile-first recreation. Finally, we used SCAMPER to solve the "Jurisdiction Wall" with a Unified Replay Nexus and established the business economy through a "Punting Patreon" model.
