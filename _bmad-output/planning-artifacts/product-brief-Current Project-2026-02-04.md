# Product Brief: Current Project

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** AI Native Horse Racing Platform (Working Title)
**Concept:** The "Strava for Punters" — A Strategic Intelligence Platform.

The platform is a unified "Homebase" for horse racing enthusiasts that solves the fragmentation of Australian racing data and video. Unlike legacy incumbents (Racenet, Punters.com.au) that target an older demographic with static data, this platform is designed for the modern, digital-native user.

It is **not** a betting agency; it is a **betting companion**. Its core value lies in aggregating cross-jurisdiction content and providing an **"AI Wingman"** that gamifies financial discipline and strategic improvement, making the *process* of punting as engaging as the *result*.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement
The modern punter is underserved by legacy platforms that are siloed, static, and geared towards "churn and burn" betting.
1.  **Fragmentation:** Video and form data are locked behind state-based jurisdiction walls.
2.  **Legacy UX:** Incumbents lack the dynamic, "dashboard" feel expected by the Discord generation.
3.  **Passive Tools:** Current "Blackbooks" are dumb lists that don't validate ideas or active risk.
4.  **The "Loser's Loop":** Betting apps are designed to break discipline; no tool exists to *reinforce* it.

### Proposed Solution
An **AI-Native Intelligence Platform** that serves as the user's "Racing Command Center."
*   **Unified Dashboard:** A single interface for all states, consolidating video, form, and news.
*   **AI-Enhanced Blackbook:** A dynamic system where users input strategy, and AI validates, course-corrects, and alerts based on specific conditions.
*   **Gamified Bankroll Management:** Visualizing financial discipline (e.g., "Health Bars", "Streaks") to make responsible punting addictive.
*   **Agent Persona Marketplace:** Users can choose their "Wingman" personality (e.g., The Sniper, The Grinder) to match their style.
*   **Seamless Handoff:** Acting as a "Launchpad" with smart deep-links to wagering operators.

### Key Differentiators
1.  **"Strava for Punters":** Focus on metrics, improvement, and "Good Decisions" rather than just winning.
2.  **Generational UX:** Mobile-first, dark mode, notification-heavy experience for the "Discord Generation."
3.  **Active AI:** The platform acts as a coach that stress-tests user ideas.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### 1. Salty Sam (The Strategic Punter)
*   **Role:** The "Pro-Am" Veteran. 10+ years experience.
*   **Motivation:** **Efficiency & Edge.** He knows how to find winners but is bogged down by "admin"—checking multiple sites, managing spreadsheets, and manually monitoring market moves.
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   **Fragmentation:** Logins for 3 different state racing bodies to watch replays.
    *   **Manual Overhead:** spending hours updating spreadsheets to track P&L.
    *   **FOMO:** Missing a "setup" because he was busy at work.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** When the "Conditional Sentinel" alerts him: *"Hey Sam, 'ThunderBolt' is running today, Track is Heavy 8, Odds are $12. This matches your Setup."* (He didn't have to check the fields manually).

#### 2. Aspiring Arthur (The Student)
*   **Role:** The Improver. Bet heavily on weekends, listens to punting podcasts.
*   **Motivation:** **Mastery.** He wants to transition from "guessing" to "knowing." He is hungry to learn *why* pros bet on certain horses.
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   **Knowledge Gap:** Form guides are dense and intimidating.
    *   **Lack of Feedback:** He loses money and doesn't know if it was bad luck or bad strategy.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** When the AI Wingman challenges him: *"Arthur, you're backing 'FastLad', but 80% of winners at this track today have been leaders. 'FastLad' is a backmarker. Proceed?"* (The platform is teaching him track bias).

#### 3. Casual Cathy (The Social Punter)
*   **Role:** The Weekend Warrior. Bets for fun, entertainment, and social connection.
*   **Motivation:** **Entertainment & Safety.** She wants to enjoy the thrill without losing her shirt. She loves the "gamification" of life (Strava, Duolingo).
*   **Pain Points:** 
    *   **Overwhelm:** Traditional apps are "ugly spreadsheets."
    *   **Churn:** She stops betting for months after a bad losing streak.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** Seeing her "Discipline Streak" badge light up because she *skipped* a bad race, giving her a dopamine hit without spending a dollar.

### User Journey (The "Homebase" Loop)

1.  **Trigger (Notification):**
    *   *Sam:* Receives a "Setup Alert" for a specific horse.
    *   *Arthur:* Receives a "Race Preview" summary.
    *   *Cathy:* Receives a "Streak Reminder."
2.  **Action (The Command Center):**
    *   Users open the app (Single Sign-On).
    *   They watch the Replay (Unified Video Player) directly in the feed.
    *   They consult the **AI Wingman** for a second opinion.
3.  **Variable Reward (The Insight):**
    *   The AI validates the strategy or flags a risk.
    *   Users feel "Smart" and "Prepared."
4.  **Investment (The Handoff):**
    *   User clicks "Launch Bet" (Deep-link to Bookie).
    *   User logs the bet in the "Automated P&L" (or it auto-syncs later).
    *   **Health Bar** updates to show remaining bankroll.

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric
**"Session Intensity" (Adjusted for Persona)**
Instead of generic DAU, we measure depth of engagement during key windows:
*   **Saturday Saturation (Cathy/Arthur):** Average number of races interacted with (Replay/Wingman) per Saturday. Target: >5 races.
*   **Weekday Workflow (Sam):** Frequency of "Admin" actions (Checking Scratchings, Blackbook alerts) on non-race days.

### User Success Metrics (The "Strava" Effect)
1.  **"Money Saved" Counter:** The estimated dollar value of *avoided losses*. (Calculated when AI advises "No Bet" and the horse loses).
2.  **Discipline Streak:** The percentage of users maintaining a "Green" Health Bar (adhering to staking plans) for >4 consecutive weeks.
3.  **Trust Score (RLHF):** The ratio of "Thumbs Up" vs "Thumbs Down" on AI Wingman advice. Target: >80% positive feedback.

### Business Objectives (The "Industry Wedge")
1.  **Demographic Capture:** Achieve >60% of user base under the age of 35. (proving we own the "Discord Generation").
2.  **Launchpad Velocity:** The Click-Through Rate (CTR) from our "Wingman" advice to a Bookmaker's Bet Slip (proving we drive *qualified* volume).

### Key Performance Indicators (MVP)
*   **D30 Retention:** >40% (Proving habit formation beyond just one weekend).
*   **Agent Adoption:** % of users who customize their Agent Persona (e.g., switch from Default to "The Sniper").
*   **Viral Coefficient:** % of users who share a "Replay Clip" or "Wingman Insight" externally (WhatsApp/Discord).

## MVP Scope

### Core Features
1.  **Unified Racing Dashboard:**
    *   Single view for Race Cards, Form Data, and Video Replays across all states.
    *   Basic "Race Preview" summaries generated by AI.
2.  **AI Wingman (v1 - The Coach):**
    *   Chat interface for race analysis ("What are the risks for Horse A?").
    *   "Thumbs Up/Down" feedback loop (RLHF).
    *   Default "Balanced" persona only.
3.  **Conditional Blackbook:**
    *   Users can add horses with specific triggers (e.g., "Alert only if Track is Wet").
    *   Push Notifications when conditions are met.
4.  **Gamified Bankroll (Smart-Log Mode):**
    *   **Minimal Input:** User only enters "Selection" and "Stake."
    *   **Auto-Enrichment:** System automatically backfills all race metadata (Track, Distance, Class, Jockey, Trainer, Weather, Wind, Going, Rail Position) to build a rich dataset for future insights.
    *   Visual "Health Bar" and "Discipline Streaks."

### Out of Scope for MVP
*   **Agent Persona Marketplace:** Users cannot yet switch between "Sniper" or "Grinder" personas.
*   **Automated P&L Sync:** No direct integration with Bookmaker APIs (OAuth) or scraping of betting history.
*   **Social/Syndicate Features:** No group chats, shared blackbooks, or friend feeds.
*   **Deep-Linking to Bet Slip:** Generic redirects to bookmaker homepages only.

### MVP Success Criteria
*   **Technical:** Aggregating video/form data from 3 jurisdictions with <2s load time.
*   **Behavioral:** >30% of active users logging at least one bet manually per session (validating the "Manual Mode" isn't a blocker).
*   **Value:** "Money Saved" counter (self-reported) exceeds $10,000 across the user base in Month 1.

### Future Vision
*   **The "App Store" for Strategies:** Users creating and selling their own AI Agent Personas.
*   **True Integration:** OAuth connection with Entain/TAB for real-time P&L syncing.
*   **Syndicate Wallets:** Pooling funds for group betting managed via the "Homebase."
